Git v2.14.2 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v2.14.1
-------------------

 * Because recent Git for Windows do come with a real msgfmt, the
   build procedure for git-gui has been updated to use it instead of a
   hand-rolled substitute.

 * "%C(color name)" in the pretty print format always produced ANSI
   color escape codes, which was an early design mistake.  They now
   honor the configuration (e.g. "color.ui = never") and also tty-ness
   of the output medium.

 * The http.{sslkey,sslCert} configuration variables are to be
   interpreted as a pathname that honors "~[username]/" prefix, but
   weren't, which has been fixed.

 * Numerous bugs in walking of reflogs via "log -g" and friends have
   been fixed.

 * "git commit" when seeing an totally empty message said "you did not
   edit the message", which is clearly wrong.  The message has been
   corrected.

 * When a directory is not readable, "gitweb" fails to build the
   project list.  Work this around by skipping such a directory.

 * A recently added test for the "credential-cache" helper revealed
   that EOF detection done around the time the connection to the cache
   daemon is torn down were flaky.  This was fixed by reacting to
   ECONNRESET and behaving as if we got an EOF.

Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.
